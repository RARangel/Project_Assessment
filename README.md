## Self Assessment

The modules for Python, Database using Postgres, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization with Tableau prepared me most for the project. In all, I thought our group worked really well together, stuck to deadlines, and used Slack for communication efficiently.  We picked a relatively easy subject for the machine learning project on purpose, as to not create a project that was unrealistic or complicated.  We utilized each others' strengths.   Mine was data visualization and the machine learning code.  I thought it was an appropriate end to a very successful class on data analytics, and look forward to using all that I have learned in my professional life.
